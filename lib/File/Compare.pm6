=head1 NAME

File::Compare - Compare files to check for equality/difference

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use File::Compare;
	
	if files_are_equal("file1.txt", "file2.txt")
		{ say "These are identical files"; }
	files_are_different("foo", "bar") ?? say "diff" !! say "same";


	say "we match" if files_are_equal("x.png", "y.png", chunk_size=> 4*1024*1024);
	say "OH NOES" if files_are_different("i/dont/exist", "me/neither") ~~ Failure;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Compare checks to see if files have the same contents, by comparing them as byte-buffers if they are of the same size.

=head2 files_are_equal(), files_are_different()
  The function C<files_are_equal> returns Bool::True if the files have the same contents, Bool::False if any bytes are different, and a Failure object if an error occurs.  The other function, C<files_are_different>, returns the opposite boolean values, and is mostly provided for code readability sugar.  Note that Failure Boolifies to False, so the behavior is slightly different between the two functions.

=head2 compare_multiple_files
Another function, C<compare_multiple_files>, will compare the contents of an array of files (passed in as any mixture of Str and IO::Path objects).  It will return an array of arrays of IO::Path objects, with matching files grouped together.

=head2 chunk_size parameter
All three functions can take an optional named parameter, C<chunk_size>, which accepts any positive integer.  This parameter tells File::Compare what size of chunks should be read from the disk at once, since the read operation is often the slowest.  The default reads 8 MiB of each file at a time.  A smaller value may be more useful in a memory-limited environment, or when files are most likely different.  A larger value could improve performance when files are most likely the same.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM PERL 5 VERSION

This code returns boolean values and Failure objects instead of 1, 0, -1 for difference, equality, and failure respectively.  The read chunk size is also increased four-fold because you're not really trying to run Rakudo on a 80486 processor, are you?

=head2 Comparing Text

This Perl 6 version drops the C<compare_text> function that was included in Perl 5.  Since most text files are of managable size, consider this code, which uses Perl's native newline handling:
	C<"file1".IO.open.lines eq "file2".IO.open.lines>
Functions can be evaluated on this as well:
	C<foo( "old/script.p6".IO.open.lines ) eq foo( "new/script.p6".IO.open.lines )>
Though, you may be better off looking at a module like L<Text::Diff> instead.

=head1 TODO

Support IO objects as parameters.
